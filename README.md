# masekube
Ansible implementation of a minimal Kubernates Cluster with Keycloak for development purposes.

* Currently uses the Vagrant LXD provider so I can spin up lots of nodes on modest hardware.

This is really only used as a playground for developing and testing kubernetes behaviour. I make no guarantees that I've done anything correctly and if you know I've messed up, a github issue is always welcome.
